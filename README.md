# 3D_CD_demo
A (very much WIP) demo program that illustrates an implementation of 3D collision detection algorithm

The 3d collision detection algo is implemented from the explanation on godot (at: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/math/vectors_advanced.html - scroll down a little to get to the section Collision detection in 3D). 

It uses a point to plane distance calculation, and for that piece the explanation at https://mathinsight.org/distance_point_plane made more sense to me.

The algorithm is implemented based on Javidx9's 3D graphics engine series (part 4, see: https://youtu.be/nBzCS-Y0FcY), and uses OneLoneCoder's PixelGameEngine (see: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/Javidx9/tree/master/PixelGameEngine) for the graphics.

Have fun with it!
